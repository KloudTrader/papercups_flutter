## Known Issues

 - closeAction is not supported on Web at this point in time, this is due to the iframe absorbing all clicks before the button detected them. For more info see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/54027.
 - Some widgets such as `clipRRect` will not affect the WebView on mobile, and will not change the widget. This works on web though.
